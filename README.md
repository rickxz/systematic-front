# systematic
## Overview
A new, improved user interface for the [StArt](https://www.lapes.ufscar.br/resources/tools-1/start-1) systematic study tool. Helps researchers easily create, develop and organize their systematic studies.
Used by [systematic](https://github.com/pet-ads/systematic) as a front-end.

## How to install and run
Systematic is being developed using the **Node.js** with the **React** framework.
To run the front-end, you will need to download and install [Node.js and the npm package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) that comes with it.

To work on the project, you will need an IDE (ex: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Then, you may download or clone the application and open the project there. 

Following that, you must open a terminal on the folder the project is on (or click on the terminal button in your IDE), and run the following command to install the project's dependencies:

`npm install`

The above command must be used whenever a new dependency is added.

Now, you can use the following command to put up the webpage:

`npm run dev`

There! Now the front-end is up and running on `http://localhost:5173`. Just open that address on your browser and it should show you the running project. Make sure to keep the terminal running the server open while you use the website.

## Requests
To execute requests to the back-end, you must run it as well. Instructions to do so are located on the [systematic](https://github.com/pet-ads/systematic) repository
